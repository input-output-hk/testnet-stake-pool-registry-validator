* What

  The two scripts, =mkall.sh= and =mk.sh= generate the test case branches for the
  registry, locally.

* Prerequisites

  1. =jcli= and the =registry= tool -- actually supplied by the Nix shell in this
     repository,
  2. a checkout of the stake pool registry.

* Usage

  1. Enter the Nix shell at the top level of this repository,
  2. While inside the shell, create a checkout of the =master= branch of the
     registry somewhere, and change the current directory into its =registry=
     subdirectory,
  3. Run the =mkall.sh= script using its relative path, like that:

     : ../../../path/to/validator/tests/mkall.sh

  4. Watch everything burn.
